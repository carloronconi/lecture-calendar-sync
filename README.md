# lecture-calendar-sync
Google Apps Script (GAS) that syncs lectures sheet with calendar.

Use [Clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp#list) to clone/push/pull from GAS to local. 

Clasp [doesn't support listing sheet script projects](https://github.com/google/clasp/issues/574), so not seeing the project when 'clasp list' is expected!
